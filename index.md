quinten814 yapping shit about notebook's formchanges

## in general

- Kingdom Key's the one controlling all of Notebook's Formchanges.
- While a Formchange is active, Kingdom Key temporarily "loses its sentience" (they "regain it" after the Formchange is over). [^1]
- There's no time limit for Formchanges, however Kingdom Key does tend to get bored (when it has to stay in a "non-sentient state") and intentionally cancles the Formchange.
- Formchanges don't have any cooldown either, but because activating takes a lot of energy, Kingdom Key usually only activates them when they need to.

## radiant form

*[KH2]: Kingdom Hearts 2

*[KH3]: Kingdom Hearts 3

- While in this form, Notebook's left-side-thingy becomes very, **very** bright, and he gets a crown that is placed on his head (like the KH2 Crown).
- Notebook attacks with slashes powered by well- light. Duh.
- Missed attacks become projectiles that home onto enemies.
- Missed CHARGED attacks become beams that lock onto any fire at enemies TWICE.
- It's possible for Notebook to avoid physical attacks by turning into light energy and then back into a physical form.
- Radiant Form is somewhat like KH3 Light Form, but modified in a way that makes it *almost* ridiculously overpowered.

## converge form

- While in this form, Notebook's cover and limbs are covered with arrow patterns facing opposite directions from each other.
- Notebook can control objects like if they were on conveyor belts next to each other and moving in opposite directions (max 2 streams).
- Using the above, Notebook can move projectiles heading towards him out of his way, even if they are homing at him. However, sending them back has proven to be challenging.
- Successful slashes create considerably weaker streams with shorter lifespans.
- Kills with this Formchange's finisher creates an explosive effect exclusive to this Formchange.

[^1]: It's unclear what "losing sentience" means to Kingdom Key, however it's most likely not in a literal way, since they can still communicate to Notebook through his "heart".
