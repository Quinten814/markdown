quinten814 yapping shit about notebook's formchanges

##in general

- Kingdom Key's the one controlling all of Notebook's Formchanges.
- While a Formchange is active, Kingdom Key temporarily "loses its sentience" (they "regain it" after the Formchange is over). [^1]
- There's no time limit for Formchanges, however Kingdom Key does tend to get bored (when it has to stay in a "non-sentient state") and intentionally cancles the Formchange.
- Formchanges don't have any cooldown either, but because activating takes a lot of energy, Kingdom Key usually only activates them when they need to.
- 
[^1]: It's unclear what "losing sentience" means to Kingdom Key, however it's most likely not in a literal way, since they can still communicate to Notebook through his "heart".
