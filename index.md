# in general

- There's two types of Formchanges: Drive Forms and Weapon Enhancers. Both change Notebook's appearance in some way.
- Formchanges are obtained by forming connections with various objects - specifically, Drive Forms are created by connections with OC's and Weapon Enhancers are created from connections with characters from well-known object shows (such as BFDI, II, TNM, PPT2, ...).
- Weapon Enhancers, just like their name, enhances weapons into stronger ones that also have major changes in appearances. These are weaker than Drive Forms, but cost way less energy for Kingdom Key to change into. All of them have special attacks exclusive to each form.
- Drive Forms change Notebook's skillset completely but are more powerful and better than Weapon Enhancers. These forms change Notebook's properties (such as Radiant Form being able to turn Notebook into light energy and Converge Form turning him into moving streams). Changes in appearance are focused onto Notebook himself instead of his outfits and accessories. Forms all have their own Finish Attack with different effects on enemies.
- The only Formchange to not fall into any of these categories is Rage Form.
- Kingdom Key's the one controlling all of Notebook's Formchanges.
- While a Formchange is active, Kingdom Key temporarily "loses its sentience" (they "regain it" after the Formchange is over). [^1]
- There's no time limit for Formchanges, however Kingdom Key does tend to get bored (when it has to stay in a "non-sentient state") and intentionally cancles the Formchange.
- Formchanges don't have any cooldown either, but because activating takes a lot of energy, Kingdom Key usually only activates them when they need to.

# drive forms

## radiant form

*[KH2]: Kingdom Hearts 2

*[KH3]: Kingdom Hearts 3

- While in this form, Notebook's left-side-thingy becomes very, **very** bright, and he gets a crown that is placed on his head (like the KH2 Crown).
- Notebook attacks with slashes powered by well- light. Duh.
- Missed attacks become projectiles that home onto enemies.
- Missed CHARGED attacks become beams that lock onto any fire at enemies TWICE.
- It's possible for Notebook to avoid physical attacks by turning into light energy and then back into a physical form.
- Radiant Form is somewhat like KH3 Light Form, but modified in a way that makes it *almost* ridiculously overpowered.

## converge form

- While in this form, Notebook's cover and limbs are covered with arrow patterns facing opposite directions from each other.
- Notebook can control objects like if they were on conveyor belts next to each other and moving in opposite directions (max 2 streams).
- Using the above, Notebook can move projectiles heading towards him out of his way, even if they are homing at him. However, sending them back has proven to be challenging.
- Successful slashes create considerably weaker streams with shorter lifespans.
- Kills with this Formchange's finisher creates an explosive effect exclusive to this Formchange.

[^1]: It's unclear what "losing sentience" means to Kingdom Key, however it's most likely not in a literal way, since they can still communicate to Notebook through his "heart".
